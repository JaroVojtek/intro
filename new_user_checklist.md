Suggested checklist for new users/project contributors:

1. read [intro](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro) 
2. read specifically about [project workflow](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro#tenatative-pipeline--workflow) 
   and [simple truths]()  
3. checkpoint: based on links in intro - which parts of the pipeline are now being developed?
4. visit [St Louis FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) - an indicator landing page and API 
5. download three pandas dataframes from app <http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/>

To navigate through teams:
1. explore which area interests you most:
- data parsing (read source and provide clean output) 
- database (store parser outputs)
- frontend (creating end-user API and flask app)
- using data to solve economic problems (making end-user examples)

2. consider if you are qualified for:
- data import scheduling (manage parser job and upload to database)
- project maintenance/overall architectire (the hardest)
