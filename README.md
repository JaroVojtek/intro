Why another database for macroeconomic data?
============================================

- Machine-readable datafeeds for economic data are growing (FRED, quandl, World Bank, EIA among others), yet some important data is left behind
- In our country case - Russian macroeconomic statistics seems very fragmented and this is a roadblock to cool reproducible analysis and reliable inputs for business planning      
- Aim to to fill this gap by providing public API for macroeconomic data and examples of economic problems solved using pandas or R for analysis.
